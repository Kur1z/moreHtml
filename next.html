<h1>My University</h1>
<p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">I currently attend Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences in Newark, New Jersey. I transferred from a community college so this is my first semester at RU-N. I am a computer science major; I still have not decided on my minor but I am mostly leaning on data science but math is a close second choice.
The courses that I am currently enrolled in are Intensive programming , Mobile app development, Computer organization and architecture, calculus III, and culture and society in latin american. I am currently not in any clubs but I am interested in joining Computer Science Developers Club and the RU-N gaming club.  </p>
